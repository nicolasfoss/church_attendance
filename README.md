# Church Attendance
I use some data provided to me by a church to analyze their attendance data.  I use the vtreat package to use a cross validation technique to predict future attendance.

Additionally, I utilize linear regression and a quasipoisson model to estimate future attendance.

At the end, I utilize the ranger package to fit a random forest model to the data to see if I can improve model performance.

Feel free to ask questions and I welcome feedback.
